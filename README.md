# List To Do App

> Aplication to create to do lists, build with React/Redux and Sass. All tasks to do are on cards that are grouped in columns which are grouped in lists. Interesting functionality is possibility to drag and drop card from one column to another or just change order in column itself. Also we can search for a task using search input in right top corner.
